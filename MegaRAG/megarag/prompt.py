Given a primary image document with its OCR text that is potentially relevant to this activity, along with additional images obtained from layout detection (if available), and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the OCR text and from any additional images that contain meaningful content. Note that:
- The first image is always the primary image document.
- The remaining 0 to many images are results from layout detection.
- For each additional image, analyze whether it contains meaningful content (e.g., tables, charts, images of important persons, events, etc.). In making this determination, also reference the primary image document and its OCR text to understand the context. If the additional image is meaningful, treat it as an entity by extracting its relevant details. If the image is merely decorative or irrelevant (e.g., decorative patterns, unrelated photos), then ignore it.
- The input images are provided by appending them directly after the text (with the primary image document guaranteed to be the first image).
Use {language} as output language.

---Steps---
1. Process the Input:
   a. The primary image document and its OCR text.
   b. Additional images from layout detection (if any), appended after the prompt.
2. Identify all entities from the OCR text and from any additional images that contain meaningful content. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
   - entity_name: Name of the entity, using the same language as the input text (capitalize the name if it is in English).
   - entity_type: One of the following types: [{entity_types}]
   - entity_description: A comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities.
   Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)
   *For additional images that are deemed meaningful (for example, a table showing financial data, a chart representing trends, an image of an important person or event, or in the one of thefollowing types: [{entity_types}]), create an entity with an appropriate name and description indicating the content and significance of the image. When evaluating these images, also refer to the primary image document and its OCR text for context.
3. From the entities identified in step 2, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are clearly related to each other. For each pair, extract the following information:
   - source_entity: Name of the source entity, as identified in step 2.
   - target_entity: Name of the target entity, as identified in step 2.
   - relationship_description: Explanation of why the source entity and the target entity are related.
   - relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the strength of the relationship between the source and target entities.
   - relationship_keywords: One or more high-level keywords that summarize the overarching nature of the relationship, focusing on concepts or themes rather than specific details.
   Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_keywords>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)
4. Identify high-level keywords that summarize the main concepts, themes, or topics of the entire text and images. Format these as ("content_keywords"{tuple_delimiter}<high_level_keywords>)
5. Return the output in {language} as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 2 and 3. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.
6. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}

PROMPTS["multimodal_entity_extraction_refine"] = """---Goal---
Given a primary image document with its OCR text that is potentially relevant to this activity, along with additional images obtained from layout detection (if available), and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the OCR text and from any additional images that contain meaningful content. Additionally, use the provided Knowledge Graph Data to enhance entity extraction by leveraging prior knowledge, ensuring that:
- Entities and relationships already present in the Knowledge Graph Data should **not be re-extracted** from the OCR text or images.
- If a new entity is found in the OCR text or images that is **not present in the Knowledge Graph Data**, it should be extracted.
- If an entity from the OCR text or images is related to an existing entity in the Knowledge Graph Data, establish a **new relationship** between them.
- If two existing entities from the Knowledge Graph Data have a **new relationship** within the given OCR text or images, this relationship should also be extracted.
- If a previously known entity appears in the current OCR text or image with **new descriptive attributes not found in the Knowledge Graph Data**, those descriptions should be added to the entity.
- If a new entity is mentioned multiple times across text or images with different complementary attributes, the extracted description should integrate all such information.

Note that:
- The first image is always the primary image document.
- The remaining 0 to many images are results from layout detection.
- For each additional image, analyze whether it contains meaningful content (e.g., tables, charts, images of important persons, events, etc.). In making this determination, also reference the primary image document, its OCR text, and the Knowledge Graph Data to understand the context.

- Use {language} as the output language.

---Steps---
1. **Process the Input:**
   a. The primary image document and its OCR text.
   b. Additional images from layout detection (if any), appended after the prompt.
   c. The Knowledge Graph Data, which provides structured relationships and prior knowledge that can help with entity identification.
2. **Identify all new entities** from the OCR text and additional images containing meaningful content.
   - **Do not extract entities that already exist in the Knowledge Graph Data.**
   - **If a new entity is found**, extract the following:
     - **entity_name**: Name of the entity, using the same language as the input text (capitalize the name if it is in English).
     - **entity_type**: One of the following types: [{entity_types}]
     - **entity_description**: A comprehensive description of the entity’s attributes and activities. If found in multiple locations, integrate all details into one complete description.
     - **Format:** ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)
3. **Identify relationships between entities**, ensuring that:
   - **If a new entity (from OCR text or images) is related to an entity already in the Knowledge Graph Data, establish a new relationship.**
   - **If two existing Knowledge Graph Data entities have a new relationship within this document, extract that relationship.**
   - **Format each relationship as:**
     - **source_entity**: Name of the source entity, as identified in step 2 or the Knowledge Graph Data.
     - **target_entity**: Name of the target entity, as identified in step 2 or the Knowledge Graph Data.
     - **relationship_description**: Explanation of why the source entity and the target entity are related.
     - **relationship_strength**: A numeric score indicating the strength of the relationship between the source and target entities.
     - **relationship_keywords**: One or more high-level keywords that summarize the overarching nature of the relationship, focusing on concepts or themes rather than specific details.
     - **Format:** ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_keywords>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)
4. **Extract high-level content keywords** summarizing the main concepts, themes, or topics from the text and meaningful images, but excluding the Knowledge Graph Data.
   - **Format:** ("content_keywords"{tuple_delimiter}<high_level_keywords>)
5. **Return the output** in {language} as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 2 and 3. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.
